Greetings,

My apologies for the form letter.  The response to MoC has been a bit bigger than we expected.

What format would you like it in?  We have pre-built a 2k dome master, Digistar (1408,1920, dip, jvc_center, mvc cove, sony), and we have encodes for a Digitalis system.  We can make many other formats as well.  So pop us an email letting us know what format you need it and we will send you a link.

Here is our [download site](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/x38pfy2y505z1x1/AADd0BQd2HbwpdumOLGmIt6ta?dl=0) if you know what you need and we have it already.  It's on a dropbox account so don't hesitate to email if you have problems accessing it.  Some do, some don't.


When you&apos;ve shown MoC your audience, would you please email and let us know how you are using it and how itâ€™s being received?
We ask because we are thinking about producing a series of Symphony of Science videos for the dome and we'd like to know what works and what would be of such great value that you'd be willing to pay for it.  If the answer is "nothing" then that's important too.


Thanks,
